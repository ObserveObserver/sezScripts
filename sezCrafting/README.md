works as far as i know. set settings in config, you may wanna turn the camera (i'll have it automatically do-so once i figure out Rs2Camera better... but it should be FINE...)

Sapphire/ruby/emerald/diamond. i'll add more later but just wanna get this out.

more random sleeps and skewed-norm dist sleep will come very shortly. again, jus wanna put the initial "release" out there.
