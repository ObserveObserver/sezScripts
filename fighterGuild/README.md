Warriors Guild (i forget it's not called figthers guild, that's TES lol)

Features:

Does tokens great, banks for food. can atm be paired with autofighter to just kill cyclopses, but i will still add it.

defaults to black armor, change the enum (ill add diff ones later but i think 99% of ppl fight the black armor)

Todo:

1. settings

2. kill cyclopses

3. **REFACTOR** it's a total disaster HAHAHAHA, i got kind of lost how I was gonna split everything up then refactor once I figure it out which was a total mistake. it's just a long string of semi-related functions.
