scala scripts for Microbot, all WIP. when they're tidy ill release a jar and the pom.xml's required.

for future reference:

when compiling, lombok hates scala. but it's possible to integrate scala into your lombok'd java, esp with a java helper. in these, the plugin files serve as lombok helpers and allow us to pass getters. 

also sometimes things will just break for no reason, running Runelite lifecycle install and refreshing maven generally helps. rarely it doesn't and you're SOL and have to remerge. it's awesome.

Script ideas:

1. Barrows
2. Pickpocketing (high banrate activity, think I can figure out a way)
